# Routines to work with Rubik's 2x2x2 cube

"""
We'll call the six sides, as usual:
   Front Back   Up Down   Left Right
or F, B, U, D, L, R.

Permutations:

We'll number the cubie positions starting
at 0, front to back, up to down, left to right.
We give an alphabetic name to the cubies as well,
by listing the faces it contains, starting with
F or B, in clockwise order (looking in from outside).
   0th cubie = FLU
   1st cubie = FUR
   2nd cubie = FDL
   3rd cubie = FRD
   4th cubie = BUL
   5th cubie = BRU
   6th cubie = BLD
   7th cubie = BDR
Each cubie has three faces, so we have 24 face
positions.  We'll label them as 0 to 23, but also
with a 3-letter name that specifies the name
of the cubie it is on, cyclically rotated to
put the name of the face first (so cubie FLU
has faces flu, luf, and ufl, on sides F, L,
and U, respectively). We'll use lower case
here for clarity.  Here are the face names,
written as variables for later convenience.
We also save each number in a second variable,
where the positions are replaced by the colors that
would be there if the cube were solved and had its
orange-yellow-blue cubie in position 7, with yellow
facing down.
"""

"""
A permutation p on 0,1,...,n-1 is represented as
a list of length n-1.  p[i] = j means of course
that p maps i to j.

When operating on a list c (e.g. a list of length
24 of colors), then  p * c
is the rearranged list of colors:
   (p * c)[i] = c[p[i]]    for all i
Thus, p[i] is the location of where the color of
position i will come from; p[i] = j means that
the color at position j moves to position i.
